# Sudoku Solver
## Introduction
This repository demonstrates how to solve sudoku using linear [specifically integer] programs. 

The idea here is that an integer program should yield a more interpretable process than that of neural nets or more brute-force approaches like genetic algorithms. The run time for this approach may lose to faster alternatives, but a %timeit test shows solve times of 96.4 ms (with sample size 10 for a sample puzzle). Thus, any faster approaches will only be marginally quicker.

Keep in mind this result could be anecdotal, so take my sample findings with a grain of salt.
