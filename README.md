# Sudoku Solver
In the past week , I wondered if it would be possible to automate solving a sudoku puzzle specifically with LPs (linear programs). 
The rationale here is that linear programs are often simpler and more inferential than alternatives (such as brute force approaches and neural nets)

In the space below, I'll outline the basics of linear programming and show how sudoku puzzles can be tailored to an LP problem.
